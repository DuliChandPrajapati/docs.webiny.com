Yes, it is! 

Depending on what you use Webiny for, your hosting prices will vary though. If you host a site that rarely changes, you will be hitting the CDN all the time, which is results in negligible expenses.

[Our API](/docs/deep-dive/architecture/api) heavily employs AWS Lambda Functions. It might be worth taking a look at [AWS Labmda Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/): most of the regions cost less than 0.3$ per 1 million requests. Do the math and you will see how cheap that is. ðŸ˜‰

But there are plenty of free services out there:
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) Atlas allows you to host a free MongoDB instance.
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) allows you to initially deploy services for free. As developers, we do not have to worry about it at all.
